    "text": "Oysters and seagrass provide a wide suite of benefits to the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem, but these foundational habitats have been reduced by overharvesting, climate change, and poor water quality conditions. An extensive restoration effort is ongoing to restore 10 Chesapeake Bay tributaries by 2025, two of which being the York and Piankatank Rivers in Virginia’s Middle Peninsula. Meanwhile, seagrass monitoring surveys have shown little recovery of the once dominant Eelgrass (Zostera marina). Two ecosystem models are being developed with the Ecopath with Ecosim software to simulate the effects of varying degrees of habitat change within the system.

    "text": "The active transport of carbon from the epipelagic zone (0–200m) into the deep-pelagic zone (water column deeper than 200m) occupies a significant contribution to the biological carbon pump and serves to aid in carbon sequestration into the deep sea. Carbon export modeling is generally an extension of bioenergetic modeling, applying energetic rates with life history parameters to estimate carbon ingestion and release. Through this effort, I have developed a trait-based model that runs on an individual scale, allowing for comparisons among species and size classes. In the oceanic Gulf of Mexico, the mesopelagic micronekton fish community actively transports between 11 and 24% of the total dissolved organic carbon in the water column each year, an act primarily led by lanternfishes. Ongoing efforts aim to improve on the model structure (R-based), incorporate new processes, and refine carbon export estimates for the carbon export of mesopelagic fishes in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\n\n\nWoodstock, M.S., T.T.

    "text": "Trophic ecology studies in the mesopelagic zone generally center around diet composition or stable isotopes. However, internal parasites can provide insight into the trophic structure of an ecosystem, such as the specificity of predator diets, and foodweb topology. I compared the diet and parasite communities of 26 mesopelagic fish species from the Gulf of Mexico. Unlike other ecosystems, the parasite community of the deep-pelagic zone was very scarce, and only 1 in every 10 fishes contained a single parasite. However, I was still able to gather evidence that predators of fishes and squids were more likely to be infected by a parasite than predators of small zooplankton, and the parasite community of a fish species was influenced by the diet of that species, suggesting some degree of specificity among mesopelagic fish diets.\n\n\n\n\nWoodstock, M.S., C.A.
